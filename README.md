# Exchange
Price checker for Ragnarok: Eternal Love

This app uses the API from romexchange.com to fetch item prices for the game Ragnarok: Eternal Love. The app is done entirely using SwiftUI, as well as the Combine framework for the network request. Feel free to use, modify, or copy the code in any way you want.

The app tries to have the same navigation flow as the Exchange menu on the Ragnarok mobile game.
